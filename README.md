Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you 
developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The event tracker is a tool that is based on a calendar and gives users the ability to create events, schedule appointments, and set reminders to assist them in remaining on track.  This application will assist users in maintaining their organization and provide them with a calendar that is simple to use for all of their activities.  

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and 
produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep 
users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The program is made up of three unique displays.  The software allows users to sign up or log in depending on whether they are returning or new users, as well as see dates displays.
The end user was considered while developing the extremely user-friendly user interface design.  The layout should make it easy for users to move about the software or from one screen to another. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What 
techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the
future?

Before I started coding, I made sure I knew what the user wanted and needed.  I looked to see whether this application was simple to comprehend and didn't need much training to function properly.  To avoid making as many errors, I wrote out what I intended to construct and then stuck to it.  Most of the time, I used these tactics.  I would continue to use this for future projects since it keeps me on track and within the time restriction.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this 
process important and what did it reveal?

I believe that this procedure is essential since it will assist you in locating problems that you would not have seen if you had just continued working without a plan outlining what you need to be trying to accomplish.  

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial 
planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a 
challenge?

To make this work, a slew of issues have to be addressed.  When I originally began, I attempted to do too much, so I had to go back and simplify it even more.  Overall, a calendar is simply that: a calendar.  Sometimes simplicity beats complication. In my perspective, having just three displays makes it seem cleaner and more user-friendly.

Would you want to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and abilities? Which aspect of your mobile app did you believe worked the best?

In my opinion, the user interface was the simplest to work with. This component seems to be the one I could readily get and had no significant difficulty with.
